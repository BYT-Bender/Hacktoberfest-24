## Swags of Hacktoberfest:

Many candidates get attracted to Hacktoberfest for the swags. After 4 successfully merged pull requests, as of 2024, you will be eligible to get a digital badge through Holopin to represent your participation in Hacktoberfest. As each of your four pull/merge requests is accepted by a maintainer, you‚Äôll unlock a new level in your badge, letting you customize it and showing to the community your achievement.

## How will I receive my digital badge?
You will receive a notification in your Hacktoberfest profile on the Hacktoberfest website. Additionally, you will receive an email from Holopin to claim each level of your badge

## Why isn‚Äôt there a t-shirt this year?
As Hacktoberfest has grown, so have the logistical challenges associated with creating a reward. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs no longer feasible for us to provide a free t-shirt. Nevertheless, we still want participants to have a memorable experience and receive a special memento marking their participation and the year. Instead of a t-shirt reward, we‚Äôre partnering with Holopin to provide a digital badge to each participant, making global delivery much simpler. We believe this shift will allow Hacktoberfest to continue supporting and raising awareness for open-source projects worldwide for years to come.
