# Hacktoberfest-24
Welcome to our Hacktoberfest 2024 Repository, where we celebrate the true spirit of collaboration! We invite developers, designers, and content writers to contribute and share their skills. Our mission is to empower students from UET Peshawar to actively participate in open source. Join us in making a difference by contributing to the repository!
